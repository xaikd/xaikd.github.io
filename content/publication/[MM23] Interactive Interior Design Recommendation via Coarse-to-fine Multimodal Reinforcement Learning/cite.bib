abstract = {Personalized interior decoration design often incurs high labor costs. Recent efforts in developing intelligent interior design systems have focused on generating textual requirement-based decoration designs while neglecting the problem of how to mine homeowner's hidden preferences and choose the proper initial design. To fill this gap, we propose an Interactive Interior Design Recommendation System (IIDRS) based on reinforcement learning (RL). IIDRS aims to find an ideal plan by interacting with the user, who provides feedback on the gap between the recommended plan and their ideal one. To improve decision-making efficiency and effectiveness in large decoration spaces, we propose a Decoration Recommendation Coarse-to-Fine Policy Network (DecorRCFN). Additionally, to enhance generalization in online scenarios, we propose an object-aware feedback generation method that augments model training with diversified and dynamic textual feedback. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate our method outperforms traditional methods by a large margin in terms of recommendation accuracy. Further user studies demonstrate that our method reaches higher real-world user satisfaction than baseline methods.},
