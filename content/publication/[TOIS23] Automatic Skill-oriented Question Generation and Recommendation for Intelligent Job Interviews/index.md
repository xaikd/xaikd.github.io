abstract: "Job interviews are the most widely accepted method for companies to select suitable candidates, and a critical challenge is finding the right questions to ask job candidates. Moreover, there is a lack of integrated tools for automatically generating interview questions and recommending the right questions to interviewers. To this end, in this paper, we propose an intelligent system for assisting job interviews, namely, DuerQues. To build this system, we first investigate how to automatically generate skill-oriented interview questions in a scalable way by learning external knowledge from online knowledge-sharing communities. Along this line, we develop a novel distantly supervised skill entity recognition method to identify skill entities from large-scale search queries and web page titles with less need for human annotation. Additionally, we propose a neural generative model for generating skill-oriented interview questions. In particular, we introduce a data-driven solution to create high-quality training instances and design a learning algorithm to improve the performance of question generation. Furthermore, we exploit click-through data from query logs and design a recommender system for recommending suitable questions to interviewers. Specifically, we introduce a graph-enhanced algorithm to efficiently recommend suitable questions given a set of queried skills. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DuerQues system in terms of the quality of generated skill-oriented questions and the performance of question recommendation."
