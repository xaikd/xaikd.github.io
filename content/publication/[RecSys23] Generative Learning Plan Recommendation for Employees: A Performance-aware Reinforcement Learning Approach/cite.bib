abstract = {With the rapid development of enterprise Learning Management Systems (LMS), more and more companies are trying to build enterprise training and course learning platforms for promoting the career development of employees. Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences. However, the learning preference of employees may not be the right fit for their career development, and thus it may not necessarily mean their work performance can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, how to capture the mutual correlation and sequential effects between courses, and ensure the rationality of the generated results, is also a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Generative Learning plAn recommenDation (GLAD) framework, which can generate personalized learning plans for employees to help them improve their work performance. Specifically, we first design a performance predictor and a rationality discriminator, which have the same transformer-based model architecture, but with totally different parameters and functionalities. In particular, the performance predictor is trained for predicting the work performance of employees based on their work profiles and historical learning records, while the rationality discriminator aims to evaluate the rationality of the generated results. Then, we design a learning plan generator based on the gated transformer and the cross-attention mechanism for learning plan generation. We calculate the weighted sum of the output from the performance predictor and the rationality discriminator as the reward, and we use Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) based policy gradient methods to train the generator following the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our GLAD framework compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods and reveal some interesting findings for talent management.},
